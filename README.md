The document "README_MC_toolbox.pdf" has more detailted information. It also includes a short description of the individual files and a series of tutorial tasks. They are designed to help you to understand the underlying theoretical frameworks of [1] and [2] and their implementations in Matlab. In addition, they are meant to provide you with an understanding of the great potential as well the limitations of this approach.

Feel free to use the tutorial as a basis for Matlab coding class for your students. If you do so, I would love to hear about it and your experience. 

If you have any troubles using the code or if you find a bug, please, let me know.
