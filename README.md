The document "README_MC_toolbox.pdf" has more information. It also includes a couple of tutorial tasks, if you want to use the
code to understand better the underlying theoretical frameworks.
You can also use it as basis for Matlab coding task for your students.

If you have any troubles using the code or if you find a bug, please, let me know.
